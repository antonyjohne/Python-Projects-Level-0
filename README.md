# Python Projects Level 0 (Beginners)

Learning a new programming language is both the most exciting and the most humbling experience. For me, that language has recently been Python, which I’ve been learning over these last few months. Now every coder knows that the best way to learn a language is to apply his skills to develop a project. But what happens when you don’t have the pre-requisites for a giant, ambitious project? For me, that’s where the sandbox comes in. Why not build a few sandcastles before piling up the rocks to our grand ol’ castle?

*Concepts to Keep in mind*
    
    Random Module
    Variables
    Integers
    Input/Output
    Print Statements
    While Loops
    If/Else Statements

### 1. Dice Rolling Simulator ###

Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates a rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will then print out what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6.

    
### 2. Hi/Low Guessing Game ###

Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong the user is (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.
